00-compare-two

ideas for comparing two sentences

circle art; maybe sort it? 


01-typing-log

capture everything you type and show how the vector changes over time


02-typing-log-diff

show how the current line is different than previous one by highlighting the abs dif between vectors


03-grid-diff






skip word

for every token, draw a histogram/tiny grid of how each vector changes from the whole sentence when that token isn't included.


grid-over-time

show grid of vectors, here's how they look over time as each token gets added


could show the skip-word chart and the over time chart as a grid to highlight how the importance of words changes based on another world... basically wanting to show more than just one dimension of removals




synonymous, show grid and how it changes when one of 10 tokens is inserted



related (does this thing understand that x and y are related):
type in lots of sentences, add them to a heat map like in the USE paper


decoding. can we add the average movement when queen goes to king to another sentence and find out which token substitutions closest?


does shifting tense make a uniform transformation


does this understand the difference between words, bank and bank?






maybe we should give the encoder some tasks? all of these charts are showing linear vector movements, not sure that's the best
